# Engineering Experience Course: Bank Transaction Data Pipeline

Welcome to the Engineering Experience Course project repository! This project represents a data pipeline for a bank's transactional data.

## Project Description

This project is a data pipeline for managing a bank's transactional data. The pipeline utilizes various technologies to ensure data integrity, perform validation checks, and provide visualization capabilities.

- **Data Storage and Processing:**
  - **Google Cloud Storage:** Used to store the bank's transactional data.
  - **Google Cloud Function:** Ensures that the data is properly deposited into the Google Cloud Storage bucket.

- **Data Validation and Notification:**
  - **Data Validation Rules:** A set of rules is applied to each transactional data to check for inconsistencies.
  - **Email Notification:** If any inconsistencies are found, an email is sent to the user.

- **Data Visualization:**
  - **Looker Studio:** Utilized for end-user data visualization.
  - **Streamlit:** Used for data visualization on the backend.
